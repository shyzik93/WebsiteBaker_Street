# Welcome to my WebsiteBaker's repo street!

This is the big patch for [WebsiteBaker](websitebaker.org) engine. Therefore you can find addons, templates, useful libraries here.

In this description I use the two unusual protocols for urls: repo:/anypath - for files in this repository, wb:/anypath - for files in WebsiteBaker engine.

# Addon: Markdown

repo:/modules/markdown

For using this addon you need to download [the markdown library](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown) and put it into wb:/include/
